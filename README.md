# facebook-pages-subscription-bot
To allow user to subscribe to a list of Facebook pages

This project is build for Python 3, and rely for the great work of Pyrebase and telepot. Great thanks to the team behind Pyrebase and telepot.

This is a little experiment built initially to tryout telegram bot, firebase and facebook GraphAPI, so it only contained the minimal features and very raw software structure. (it's only less than 100 lines of code anyway....)

To use it, just update the telegram bot key, firebase api key, and facebook api key in settings.py, and deploy it against any Python 3 runtime with dependencies installed.
